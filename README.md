# fillit
The aim of this project is to implement algorithm that finds optimal position for tetris pieces called tetrimino. Tetriminos should form as small square as possible.
# Project description
The description of a Tetriminos must respect the following rules :
- Precisely 4 lines of 4 characters, each followed by a new line (4x4 square).
- A Tetrimino is a classic piece of Tetris composed of 4 blocks.
- Each character must be either a block character(’#’ ) or an empty character (’.’).
- Each block of a Tetrimino must touch at least one other block on any of his 4 sides (up, down, left and right).

*Examples of valid tetriminos:* <br>
